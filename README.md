The "code" folder contains all the code for our project. All other files should be placed in the project document, outside the "code" folder. 

To recreate the results of our project, the following files must first be placed in the project folder: 995,000_rows.csv, liar_dataset.zip, news_sample.csv, and a BBC_articles.txt file containing scraped BBC articles.
Then, run the following jupyter notebook files in order:  1.1:DataProcessing.ipynb, 1.3:Preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb, 1.2:DataExploration.ipynb, 1.4:feature_representations.ipynb, 2.simple_model.ipynb, 3. advanced_model.ipynb, 4.validation.ipynb
